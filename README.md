# A compact and integral model for partitioning planar graphs with application in political redistricting

Code and data for the "A compact and integral model for partitioning planar graphs with application in political redistricting" by Jack Zhang, Hamidreza Validi, Austin Buchanan, and Illya V. Hicks.

Motivated by applications in political redistricting, we propose a linear size and compact model for partitioning a planar graph into k partitions.
